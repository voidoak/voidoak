### void* oaken_duck
I'm OakenDuck, or Void. (he/him)\
I am a 20 year old amateur programmer, from Houston, Texas.
Hoping to work in a comp sci related field, and to delve deeper into my studies into computers and hopefully increase my knowledge and understanding of the systems that run our world.

I am currently working on a discord bot [written in Python](https://discord.com/voidoakenduck/Praestes) and another in C++, as well as a Spotify client using the QT framework. You can catch me on [instagram](https://instagram.com/void_ptr_?igshid=fu3o42p0rni1) or on [my discord](https://discord.gg/5d7BzA6pWa).
